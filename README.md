Helps you parent the objects in the hierarchy by name only.

# why i made this model

To assist me in editing the shvan 92 model by Daniel Zhabotinsky. The model has unnecessary empty objects parented to the main empties and have their own mesh objects parented to them. I wanted to erase the unwanted empties without me accidentally selecting the wrong object.
